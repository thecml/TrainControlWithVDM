abstract = {The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is a state-of-the-art train control system designed as a standard for railways across Europe. It generalises traditional discrete interlocking systems to a world in which trains hold on-board equipment for signalling, and trains and interlockings communicate via radio block processors. The ERTMS aims at improving performance and capacity of rail traffic systems without compromising their safety. The ERTMS system is of hybrid nature, in contrast to classical railway signalling systems which deal with discrete data only. Consequently, the switch to ERTMS poses a number of research questions to the formal methods community, most prominently: How can safety be guaranteed? In this paper we present the first formal modelling of ERTMS comprising all subsystems participating in its control cycle. We capture what safety means in physical and in logical terms, and we demonstrate that it is feasible to prove safety of ERTMS systems utilising Real-Time Maude model-checking by considering a number of bi-directional track layouts. ERTMS is currently being installed in many countries. It will be the main train control standard for the foreseeable future. The concepts presented in this paper offer applicable methods supporting the design of dependable ERTMS systems. We demonstrate model-checking to be a viable option in the analysis of large and complex real-time systems. Furthermore, we establish Real-Time Maude as a modelling and verification tool applicable to the railway domain. The approach given in this paper is a rigorous one. In order to avoid modelling errors, we follow a systematic approach: First, as a requirement specification, we identify the event-response structures present in the ERTMS. Then, we model these structures in Real-Time Maude in a traceable way, i.e., specification text in Real-Time Maude can be directly mapped to requirements. We explore our models by checking if they have the desired behaviour, and apply systematic model-exploration through error injection â€“ both these steps are carried out using the formal method Real-Time Maude. Finally, we analyse ERTMS by model-checking, thus applying a formal method to the railway domain, and we mathematically prove that our analysis of ERTMS by model-checking is complete, i.e., that it guarantees safety at all times.},

abstract = {This paper presents the latest results of a three years project which aims at contributing to the validation and implementation of a European system for railway signaling called ERTMS "European Rail Traffic Management System". The management of railway trackside signaling in ERTMS is based on rules pertaining to each country and not on global rules. In order to perform a global safety assessment, a system analysis has to consider all these aspects. By the consequence, the main target of the project is to provide some methodological and software tools in order to perform consistency checking. The project named "Perfect" started in November 2012. The first step was to identify some critical scenarii leading to accidents or quasi accidents. The study leads us to focus on maintenance trains. In fact, even if there are not representing a big amount of the traffic, maintenance trains are involved in several critical situations. This intermediate result highlighted that there are no ERTMS running accidents because there were no ETCS2 implemented in France during the project. Consequently, the second step is to build a logical environment allowing replaying the identified scenarii under the ERTMS framework. This logical environment is obtained by a modeling task. Petri nets and B models may be used in order to provide some formal safety proofs. These two modeling tools are well accepted by some railway actors. Nevertheless ERTMS textual specification is not so formal. A semi-formal language like SysML seems to be well fitted to produce some intermediate models. A petri net model of the interlocking was proposed and a UML4secure Model was presented. The transformations of these two models into B machines have been published. Now we are able to prove some safety invariants on this global model of the system. In the last step of the project, based on the formal model some tests are generated, and then executed on the ERTMS simulation tool compliant with the official specifications. There are two kinds of motivations. The first one is to validate the assumption used by the safety proofs produced by the formal models. The second one is to play the critical scenarii in the 3D environment of the ERTMS compliant simulation tool. The scenarii are obtained from two different procedures. Firstly, the accident database analysis allows defining some critical elements. Secondly, when the formal analysis failed at providing all proofs, the corresponding scenario has to be tested. The influences of infrastructure design and working context have been revealed in this last step. During this three years project, an instrumented methodology based on formal methods and a 3D simulation framework has been developed. This global framework does not avoid all difficulties, but it may allow producing a safety proof in shortest and more deterministic time.},

abstract = {ERTMS is the standard railway control-command and signaling system which aims to ensure railway interoperability throughout Europe while enhancing safety and competitiveness. ERTMS is composed of two main subsystems which include GSM-R, a radio system for enabling communication between the train and the traffic management center and ETCS, an automatic train protection system (ATP) to replace the existing national ATP systems. The ERTMS specifications are defined by means of standard documents which set out the requirements ensuring interoperability. These documents evolve regularly to give rise to successive versions. The ERTMS/ETCS standard defines different levels and operation modes according to various trackside and onboard setups and some operational conditions. Given the complexity and the high criticality of railway operation, verification and validation (V{\&}V) are crucial tasks in railway application development. In this paper, after setting the background and the motivations, a mechanizable formalization of a subset of ERTMS/ETCS specifications relative to ETCS modes and transitions is developed. The present work aims to offer a readily available model for formal V{\&}V. Using formal techniques to check SRS is highly recommended to tackle the complexity of the defined requirements and prevent specification errors. Model-checking technique, which is targeted here, offers exhaustive analysis of the system behavior based on its model and is highly automated, since it is supported by software tools. Based on the last available version of SRS specifications, a progressive process is undertaken to get a formal model which makes explicit the various modes characterized by their respective active functions, as well as the numerous combinations of conditions for switching between modes. The various steps guiding the translation of the SRS literal specifications into a formal model are explained. As will be shown through different examples, the obtained model is a convenient basis to check safety, interoperability and liveness properties. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Interoperability is a critical factor for cost cutting and to increase performance in European railway exchanges. The European Railways Traffic Management System (ERTMS), which is both a specification and a technological framework, aimed at providing an answer to the above interoperability needs. Considering the implementation of ERTMS in a particular national context, operating rules must be compliant with the ERTMS specification, whereas the whole system has to provide some safety properties. Moreover, the management of railway signalling in ERTMS is based on "not on board rules" pertaining to each country and not on global rules. In consequence, it is difficult to evaluate the system in terms of safety. Thus, one of the main purposes of this study is to supply methodological tools for the evaluation of the global consistency between the specification and the operating rules, with regard to safety. This issue is crucial and yet it has scarcely been covered by scientific literature. {\textcopyright} 2014 WIT Press.},
